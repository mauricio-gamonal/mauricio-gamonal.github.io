Quantum gravity is often portrayed as a purely formal enterprise: a search for mathematical consistency in regimes that seem hopelessly far from experiment. As discussed by Bronstein as early as 1936, the Planck scale is the natural regime of quantum gravity, i.e., where the typical area is $\ell_{P}^2 = G\hbar/c^3 \sim 10^{-70} m^2$. At this level, Planckian curvature seems unreachable, microscopic spacetime structures appear inaccessible, and direct probes of quantum geometry seem out of sight. However, this picture misses something essential. The early Universe *is* a quantum-gravitational system, and traces of that regime remain observable today.

The key point is that a characteristic scale governing the primordial epoch of the Universe is imprinted in the observed amplitude of the CMB temperature anisotropies, which are typically $\delta T /T_0 \sim 10^{-5}$. In this sense, very early cosmology seems to be the only setting in which we can realistically hope to confront features of quantum gravity with observational data, in particular, by decoding the long-wavelength imprints left on cosmic correlations.

## Quantum gravity without Planckian experiments

The key insight is that quantum gravity can manifest through the **structure of correlations**, the **organization of degrees of freedom**, and the **effective dynamics** governing fluctuations around an emergent spacetime.

Inflationary cosmology already teaches us this lesson. The primordial power spectrum encodes the quantum nature of cosmological perturbations, stretched from microscopic origins to astronomical scales. What is quantized here is not just a scalar field in isolation, but a coupled system of matter and geometry: the Coulombic, non-radiative sector of gravity itself. In this sense, cosmological observations have already probed quantum aspects of spacetime, albeit within a controlled semiclassical regime.

This perspective reframes the problem of quantum gravity. The question is no longer *how to quantize spacetime*, which is already available perturbatively, but rather:

> **How do quantum-gravitational degrees of freedom organize themselves into effective, semiclassical descriptions capable of producing observable correlations?**

## Effective theories as bridges, not shortcuts

Doing phenomenology is very hard, as one typically does need a robust theoretical framework where controlled approximations can be used. From this viewpoint, effective theories are bridges between fundamentally quantum descriptions and observational regimes. One effective theory that is quite useful because of its similarity with the known structure of general relativity is effective field theory (EFT). The corrections due to a fundamental theory of spacetime geometry can be organized in terms of derivatives of the metric. The most general diffeomorphism-invariant action up to quartic order is given by

$$ S [g_{\mu\nu}] = \frac{1}{16\pi G} \int d^4 x  \sqrt{-g} (R+\alpha R^2 - \beta W^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}W_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}) $$


These higher-curvature terms should be understood as remnants of deeper quantum dynamics rather than ad-hoc modifications. Crucially, primordial cosmology offers a controlled arena in which these effective descriptions can be tested. The early Universe selects specific initial states, amplifies particular modes, and filters quantum information through cosmic expansion. This makes it possible to ask sharply defined questions about unitarity, equivalence of quantizations, and the emergence of semiclassical degrees of freedom, questions that are central to quantum gravity, yet rarely accessible elsewhere.

In this specific EFT, and as we describe in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10081), the characteristic scale of the quasi-de Sitter phase that emerge naturally from its dynamics is encoded in $\alpha \sim 10^{10} \, \ell_{P}^2$. One can check directly that the amplitude of the primordial power spectrum of perturbations, is of the form $\mathcal{A}_s \sim N_\ast^2 \ell_{P}^2/\alpha$, where $N_\ast$ is the number of e-foldings of inflation, i.e., the duration of the quasi-de Sitter phase.


## A conceptual laboratory

Calling primordial cosmology a “laboratory” does not mean that it replaces accelerators or detectors. Rather, it provides something equally valuable: a **conceptual and practical testing ground**. It can help to constrain how quantum gravity must behave if it is to be compatible with the observed Universe.

Any viable theory of quantum gravity must explain how semiclassical spacetime emerges, how specific degrees of freedom dominate cosmological perturbations, and how quantum correlations survive cosmic evolution in the precise way we observe. Primordial cosmology sharpens these demands and turns them into concrete questions.

In this light, the early Universe is not just a boundary condition for fundamental physics. It is an active probe of quantum spacetime, one that continues to inform us, through the cosmic microwave background and gravitational waves, about the deep structure of gravity itself.
