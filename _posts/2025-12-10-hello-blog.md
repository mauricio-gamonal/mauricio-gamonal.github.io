This is a test post! Here I can mix informal comments with
equations, references and maybe a figure or two.

For example, a teaser:

> The early universe provides a unique window into Planckian physics
> through the imprint of quantum fluctuations on the CMB.

And a small equation (if you're using MathJax):

$$\oint f(z) dz = 0$$
