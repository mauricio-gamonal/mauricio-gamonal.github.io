This is a test post! Here I can mix informal comments with
equations, references and maybe a figure or two.

For example, a teaser:

> The early universe provides a unique window into Planckian physics
> through the imprint of quantum fluctuations on the CMB.

And a small equation (if you're using MathJax):

\\[
\mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{R}}(k) = A_s \left(\frac{k}{k_\star}\right)^{n_s - 1 + \frac{1}{2}\alpha_s \ln(k/k_\star) + \cdots}.
\\]
