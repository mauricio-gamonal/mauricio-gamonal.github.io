Hello, there! I'm Mauricio Gamonal, a Chilean theoretical physicist and Fulbright fellow through the ANID-BIO Scholarship. Currently, I pursue a PhD in Physics at the Pennsylvania State University under the supervision of Prof. Eugenio Bianchi. 

My work explores the interface between Quantum Mechanics and Gravity, both from theoretical and phenomenological perspectives. I have recently studied the physics of purely gravitational models of cosmic inflation and its consequences for precision cosmology. However, I will be soon pushing towards the fully quantum regime, particularly within the framework of the spinfoam approach to quantum gravity. 

Previously, I graduated of a MSc in Theoretical Physics and a BSc in Physics, both at the Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile, under the supervision of Prof. Jorge Alfaro.
