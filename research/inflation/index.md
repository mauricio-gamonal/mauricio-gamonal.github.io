# My interest in Cosmic Inflation

My fascination with cosmic inflation lies at the interface between quantum mechanics and gravity. This early period of rapid expansion in the universe offers a unique window into the fundamental workings of the universe, where the principles of quantum mechanics influence gravitational forces at the largest scales. Understanding this interplay not only provides insights into the origins of the universe but also helps in unifying the theories of the very small and the very large.
